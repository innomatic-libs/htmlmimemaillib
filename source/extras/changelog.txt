 Changelog
===========

??/??/2001

  -  Altered set_charset() function. Now simply pass in the charset you wish to set.

  -  Altered quoted-printable encoding not to encode tabs.

08/09/2001

  -  General tidy up.

  -  Altered default length of 7bit encoded data to 998 chars (RFC821).

  -  Added example.4.php, which shows how to send Bcc: emails.

29/08/2001

  -  Added quoted-printable functionality (RFC2045).

  -  Added argument to build_message() to control certain things during message building.

27/08/2001

  -  Added new function contributed by Dan Allen. Will look through the html
     code for embedded images/files and try to automatically add them. The function
     is called by adding a third argument to add_html(), which is the directory
     where the function will look for images.

  -  smtp_send() method no longer automatically adds From: or Subject: headers. These
     must be added manually. The arguments have also changed for this function.

  -  Two example scripts added, making total of three. Each of which shows the various
     ways you can use the class.

17/07/2001

  -  Moved the mime version header to be the first header added to the mail.
     Apparently this helps certain mail clients.

28/01/2001

  -  Changed all \r\n to \n. Should work "out of the box" for more people now. However,
     this does contravene RFC822, which states line endings should be \r\n.

24/10/2000

  -  Added character set function. Contributed by "Matt". Also
     fixed the properties' initialisation by moving it to the
     constructor. Default character set is us-ascii.

31/08/2000

  -  Couple of bugfixes. Also, due to a mis-directed
     complaint from a victim of porn spam, I have removed
     the link to my website from the "This is a mime encoded
     email." message. Please upgrade.

24/08/2000

  -  Changed all functions that add headers to accept either a string
     of headers seperated by \r\n, a single header, or an array of headers.

  -  Added get_rfc822() function. Enables you to add whole emails as attachments
     to other emails.

  -  Added add_header() function to add a header. This is php4 only, and takes
     any number of arguments. The args must be either arrays full of headers or
     a string containing a header.

  -  Added get_mime() function as an accessor to get the mime class variable.

  -  Added the set_body() function to set the body text class variable. This
     is to be used to set the body text when it is not an HTML mail being sent.

Previous History

  - Fixed bug; when looping with $obj->send(), From: headers
    were accumulating. Bummer. Thanks to Lance Rasmussen for
    notifying me.

  - Fixed bug; $html_images was tested to be an array or not
    but was set to be an array during object creation, so the
    test always returned true. Thanks to Bob Silva for
    notifying me.

  - Fixed bug; certain mail systems (gmx.net in particular)
    were rejecting mail because of a space character either
    side of the equal sign on the boundary line. Thanks to
    Peter Holm for notifying me.

  - Made headers terminated by CRLF instead of LF, now
    compliant with RFC822.

  - Thanks to Thomas Flemming for supplying a fix
    for Win32.
